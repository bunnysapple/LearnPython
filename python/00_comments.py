# Welcome to the python tutorial. Is this a tutorial? Idk.

# My name is Athul.
# For me, this is a project of that I'm building to help you learn the bare fundamentals of
# python. And, judging by the fact that you're here, I'm guessing you want to try your hand
# at learning python. That or you're someone looking through my profile, in which case, hi.

# Before we start, I have to tell you that I myself am no python genius, just someone who somewhat
# knows their way around this highly versatile programming language.

# Regardless, I hope this is helpfull to you on your journey. I'll try my best to explain the
# bits and pieces that I've found very helpfull. I am someone who believes that you learn best
# by doing, so this will focus on some problem solving with python to help you better
# understand how to apply the knowledge I hope to teach you.

# I'll be explaining key concepts in python such as assigning variables, types, functions, etc.

# Google, or whatever site you use to browse the internet, is going to be your best friend
# when it comes to programming. 

# Now, to get started.
# First thing on our list is comments.
# Ironically, comments are us telling the computer that this bit isn't code to be read.

# Now, I already used a few comments, so you might already get it.
# But, to make a single line comment, you put a "#" in front of the line you want to comment out.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Make a comment about what you like the most in the world down here:

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# Yay, you made a single line comment. I sure as hell hope you did cause, if you didn't, I just
# made myself look stupid. Good job.

# I keep referring to it as a "single line comment", implying that there's more
# There is, technically. Nope. But let me explain.

"""
This can be considered a mult line comment. Technically. It works the part for sure. But it isn't
intended to be such.
"""
'''
This is the same as above. I'm using three instances of quotation marks, single or double, and
anything sandwiched between them is a long string that is never assigned to a variable and never
used anywhere in the code and so functions similarly to a comment (will get to strings and
variables in a quick bit).
'''

# Officially, there are no other types of comments, other than single line comments, in python.
# What I did above should not really be used and is just bad practice.

# Final exercise for comments:
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Give yourself a nickname and write it here:
