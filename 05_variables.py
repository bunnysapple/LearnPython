# Now we know how to create functions in python which does certain actions and return results.
# But, what if we want to store data to be used elsewhere?

# Imaging you have a large paragraph of text that you have to print 5 times in different places.
# Writing a print function containing those paragraphs 5 times out seems like a waste of space and effort.

# Here's where variables come in. Variables are keywords of sorts that we assign values to.
# You've probably worked with the concept before in things like maths.
# For example, if you have a wuestion that asks you to "Find the variable x when 2x = 4", "x" represents
# a value. In this case it represents 2.
# Likewise, in programming, you can assign values to key words we cal variables.

# Example:
hello = "Hello, World!"

# Above I've defined a variable called "hello" and I've assigned the value "Hello, World!" to it.
# Uncomment the below print statement and run the code to see the result.

# print(hello)

# If you are struggling to run the code, I'd recommend looking back through the files or searching up
# how to run the code on Google. Google is your best friend when learning and use it wisely.

# Now, hopefully, after running the code, you've seen the phrase "Hello, World!" printed on your terminal.
# Great. Now, can you try print it multiple times bellow using the print function?

# Exercise:
# Use the print function to print the variable "hello" 5 times down below.



# Great job with that. So, let's explain.
# To define a variable in python, you need to come up with a name.
# Good practice with naming in python is that you use lower case.
# If you have a two word name, you seperate the words with "_".
# Some people also use camel case, "camelCase" instead of "camel_case".

# Once you have a name and wrote it down, you use an equal sign in the middle.
# This is to equate the variable to what the variable represents.

# After the equal sign, you have what the variable represents.
# In our case, in the above example, the variable "hello" represents the phrase "Hello, World!"

# Variables can represent a range of things, such as numbers, lists of numbers or phrases, other variables, etc.
