# You've seen two arithmetic operators so far; "+" and "-" operators.

# Here, we'll start to recap on those two operators and learn a bit more about them before we do
# jump to exercises.

# Let's go through all the main arithmetic operators in python.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

## '+' operator ##
# If you want to see it in action, check 01_functions.py file. I have defined a function that takes
# in a value and adds one to the value, using this operator. '+' is the addition operator and is used
# in mathematical operations to add vales together.

# Example:
print(2 + 3) # This prints the sum of 2 and 3, which is 5.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

## '-' operator ##
# This is the subtraction operator. This operator is used for subtracting values and finding their differences.
# You've used it in the 02_functions.py file when creating the functions.

# Example:
print(8 - 3) # This prints the difference between 8 and 3, which is 5

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

## '*' operator ##
# '*' is the multiplication operator and  is used for multiplying values.

# Example:
print(4 * 2) # This prints the result of 4 x 2, which is 8

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

## '**' operator ##
# '**' operator is the exponentiation operator. It's used to find the value of a value to the power of another
# value.

# Example:
print(3 ** 2) # This will give you the value for 3Â², which is 9.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

## '/' operator ##
# '/' is known as the division operator. It's used in arithmetic functions for dividing numbers.

# Example:
print(4 / 3) # This calculates the absolute vlalue of this division, which is 1.3333333...

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

## '%' operator ##
# '%' is called the modulus operator. This operator is used when you want the remainder when dividing
# two values.

# Example:
print(3 % 2) # This prints the value left over once you split 3 of something into pairs of 2, which is 1.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

## '//' operator ##
# '//' operator is called the floor division operator. It is used in floor division, whcich is where you
# divide to get the closest non-decimal value when rounding down.

# Example:
print(3 // 2) # This calculates and prints the number of times 2 can fully go into 3, which is one times.
