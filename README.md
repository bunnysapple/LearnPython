# Learn Python

This is a small personal project that I wish to do, between projects, to help consolidate my knowledge of python while also sharing it with others. Follow this step by step guide to learn the basics of the python language. This was heavily inspired by a course on replit that I myself used to get started with python and I will try to link that down below as well.

## Installations

These installation guides are very basic and are aimed at Windows users, as that is the operating system I am most familiar with. I have provided external links for others who would rather visit a YouTube tutorials or for those who have an operating syster other than Windows.

### IDE/Text Editor

A key aspect of programming is, yknow, actually programming? And you can't always code things in your browser. So, what you use instead is an IDE, or a Text Editor, as your codespace for you to work in. These are really impressive softwares that help. For this project, you will be required to clone this repository and run it locally and you will be needing an IDE or Text Editor for that.

What I like to use is Visual Studio Code, which is a free and popular Text Editor made by Microsoft, for programming. I like Visual Studio Code as it is highly customisable, with it's many extensions, and the ease of use for beginners. It's also very easy to install and start coding with, so I'll be outlining how to install it. If you already have it installed, or prefer a different IDE/Text Editor, feel free to skip this bit and follow along.

The videos were produced by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ProgrammingKnowledge" target="_blank">ProgrammingKnowledge</a> and are not my property.

- #### Step 1

  Follow <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">this</a> link to visual studio code home page: https://code.visualstudio.com/

  It should look something like this:

  ![Visual Studio Code Home Page](https://i.postimg.cc/nhjnGzZD/Visual-Studio-Code-Home.png)

- #### Step 2

  Install the right installer for your operating system. I have a Windows OS so I would install the Windows user installer. Usually the right one is recommended for you up front, but click the blue arrow for more options.

  ![Visual Studio Code Installer Options](https://i.postimg.cc/R0TCNY4s/Visual-Studio-Code-Options.png)

  Once you've selected, the installer should start to be downladed. Open it once the download is completed.

- #### Step 3

  Once the Visual Studio Code User Setup window opens up, it should look something like this:

  ![VisualStudioCodeUserSetup](https://i.postimg.cc/sDbznrTG/Visual-Studio-Code-Setup.png)

  Read and accept the user agreement, click Next button to continue.

- #### Step 4

  Choose the location data for running Visual Studio Code. This can be the default location and no changes are necessary.

  However, I do prefer choosing the "Create a desktop icon" button once you get to this prompt.

  This is optional and you can choose not to have a desktop icon if you prefer.

- #### Step 5

  Press install to start the installation of Visual Studio Code:

### Python

Next thing on our list is Python. We need to install python to be able to run python or use python packages on our device.

Once again, if you'd like a video tutorial on installing python, visit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUct6dAfCds&t=120s" target="_blank" >this</a> link if you have a Windows OS, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhv82tvFfkM" target="_blank">this</a> link if you have a Mac and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LFTujbSdl8" target="_blank">this</a> link if you have a linux. None of these videos belong to me, these are educational videos that have been made available on YouTube.

- #### Step 1

  Go to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Python download page</a> on the official Python website.

  It should look like this:

  ![Python Download Page](https://i.postimg.cc/4dv3dRrS/Python-Download-Page.png)

  Choose the right link, based on your operating system, to start the installation of the installer. Usually, this just means pressing the yellow button.

- #### Step 2

  Open the Installer. Make sure the "add python.exe to PATH" box at the bottom is ticked before pressing "Install Now" to start the installation.
  
  If you would like to customize enything, feel free to press the "Customize Installation" button.

This should do it for installing python. To confirm, close any shell or Visual Studio Code window you may have opened and then reopen a Visual Studio Code window.

Pres ctrl + ' to open a console.

Copy and paste the below into the console.

```
python --version
```

It should return something like:
```
Python 3.12.4
```

### Python Extensions in VS Code

Before we start working with python, let's install the python extension for Visual Studio Code.

Open Visual Studio Code. You might have initial prompts asking you to select your environment settings, like the background color, so select those first if you hadn't already, when testing if python was installed correctly.

Your VS Code Window should look something like this:

![Visual Studio Code Welcome Page](https://i.postimg.cc/kGSHZ5Nh/Visual-Studio-Code-Welcome-Page.png)

Click The "Extensions" icon on the left side to open up extensions.

![Visual Studio Code Extensions](https://i.postimg.cc/mDYM5fzy/Visual-Studio-Code-Extensions.png)

You'll likely won't have any extensions installed, unlike me. Type in "python" and select "Pyhton" extension by Micosoft. It is likely the first one on the list.

It will open up a tab similar to this:

![Python Extension](https://i.postimg.cc/BbJDWY29/Python-Extension.png)

You won't have it installed like I do, so go ahead and install it.

#### Git

Git is what you'll be using to clone this repository from github. Because of this, you'll be required to donwload git and set it up before you start this project.
