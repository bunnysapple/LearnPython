# Learn Python

This is a small personal project that I wish to do, between projects, to help consolidate my knowledge of python while also sharing it with others. Follow this step by step guide to learn the basics of the python language. This was heavily inspired by a course on replit that I myself used to get started with python and I will try to link that down below as well.
