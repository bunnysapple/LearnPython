# Learn Python

This is a small personal project that I wish to do, between projects, to help consolidate my knowledge of python while also sharing it with others. Follow this step by step guide to learn the basics of the python language. This was heavily inspired by a course on replit that I myself used to get started with python and I will try to link that down below as well.

### Installations

If you are a beginner and do not have IDE/Text Editor or Python or Git installed, visit the [installations](/INSTALLATIONS.md) file.

I have provided step by step guide to helping you install Visual Studio Code, Python, Python Extensions and Git.

There are also links to video instructions if you'd prefer that.
