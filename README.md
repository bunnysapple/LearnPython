# Learn Python

This is a small personal project that I wish to do, between projects, to help consolidate my knowledge of python while also sharing it with others. Follow this step by step guide to learn the basics of the python language. This was heavily inspired by a course on replit that I myself used to get started with python and I will try to link that down below as well.

## Installations

### IDE/Text Editor

A key aspect of programming is, yknow, actually programming? And you can't always code things in your browser. So, what you use instead is an IDE, or a Text Editor, as your codespace for you to work in. These are really impressive softwares that help. For this project, you will be required to fork this repository and run it locally and you will be needing an IDE or Text Editor for that.

What I like to use is Visual Studio Code, which is a free and popular Text Editor made by Microsoft, for programming. I like Visual Studio Code as it is highly customisable, with it's many extensions, and the ease of use for beginners. It's also very easy to install and start coding with, so I'll be outlining how to install it. If you already have it installed, or prefer a different IDE/Text Editor, feel free to skip this bit and follow along.

- #### Step 1

  Follow [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/) link to visual studio code home page: https://code.visualstudio.com/

  It should look something like this:

- #### Step 2

  Install the right installer for your operating system. I have a Windows OS so I would install the Windows user installer. Usually the right one is recommended for you up front, but click the blue arrow for more options.

  Once you've selected, the installer should start to be downladed. Open it once the download is completed.

- #### Step 3

  Once the Visual Studio Code User Setup window opens up, it should look something like this:

  Read and accept the user agreement, click Next button to continue.

- #### Step 4

  Choose the location data for running Visual Studio Code. This can be the default location and no changes are necessary.

  However, I do prefer choosing the "Create a desktop icon" button once you get to this prompt.

  This is optional and you can choose not to have a desktop icon if you prefer.

- #### Step 5

  Press install to start the installation of Visual Studio Code:

### Python

Next thing on our list is Python. We need to install python to be able to run python or use python packages on our device.

- #### Step 1

  Go to [Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on the official Python website.

  It should look like this:

  Choose the right link, based on your operating system, to start the installation of the installer. Usually, this just means pressing the yellow button.
