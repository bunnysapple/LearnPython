# It's testing time!!
# Time to put your newly learned operators skills to the test.


# Exercise 1: Addition
#============================================================================================================#
# Define a function called add_nums that adds together two numbers and returns the value.
# Use your knowledge of functions and operators.



# Uncomment the following two lines before running the code.
# addition = Test_Operator(add_nums, "add")
# addition.tests()
#============================================================================================================#


# Exercise 2: Subtraction
#============================================================================================================#
# Define a function called subtract_nums that returns the difference between two numbers.
# You've already done this but, hey, no harm in repeating. Try not to look back at previous files this time.
# Use your knowledge of functions and operators.



# Uncomment the following two lines before running the code.
# subtraction = Test_Operator(subtract_nums, "minus")
# subtraction.tests()
#============================================================================================================#


# Exercise 3: Multiplication
#============================================================================================================#
# Define a function called multiply_nums that returns the multiple of two numbres.
# Use your knowledge of functions and operators.



# Uncomment the following two lines before running the code.
# multiplication = Test_Operator(multiply_nums, "multiply")
# multiplication.tests()
#============================================================================================================#


# Exercise 4: Division
#============================================================================================================#
# Define a function called divide_nums that returns the result of dividing the first number with the second.
# Use your knowledge of functions and operators.



# Uncomment the following two lines before running the code.
# division = Test_Operator(divide_nums, "divide")
# division.tests()
#============================================================================================================#


# Exercise 5: Floor Division
#============================================================================================================#
# Define a dunction called floor_nums that returns the result of floor dividing two numbers.
# Use your knowledge of functions and operators.



# Uncomment the following two lines before running the code.
# floor_division = Test_Operator(floor_nums, "floor")
# floor_division.tests()
#============================================================================================================#


# Exercise 6: Exponentiation
#============================================================================================================#
# Define a function called exponentiate_nums which takes two numbers as inputs and returns the first number
# to the power of the second number.
# Use your knowledge of functions and operators.



# Uncomment the following two lines before running the code.
# exponentiation = Test_Operator(exponentiate_nums, "exponent")
# exponentiation.tests()
#============================================================================================================#


# Exercise 7: Modulus
#============================================================================================================#
# Define a function called modulus_division which takes two numbers as input and returns the remainder when
# the first number is divided by the second number
# Use your knowledge of functions and operators.



# Uncomment the following two lines before running the code.
# modulus = Test_Operator(modulus_division, "modulus")
# modulus.tests()
#============================================================================================================#
