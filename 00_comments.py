# Welcome to the python tutorial. Is this a tutorial? Idk.

# My name is Athul.
# For me, this is a project of that I'm building to help you learn the bare fundamentals of
# python. And, judging by the fact that you're here, I'm guessing you want to try your hand
# at learning python. That or you're someone looking through my profile, in which case, hi.

# Before we start, I have to tell you that I myself am no python genius, just someone who somewhat
# knows their way around this highly versatile programming language.

# Regardless, I hope this is helpfull to you on your journey. I'll try my best to explain the
# bits and pieces that I've found very helpfull. I am someone who believes that you learn best
# by doing, so this will focus on some problem solving with python to help you better
# understand how to apply the knowledge I hope to teach you.

# I'll be explaining key concepts in python such as assigning variables, types, functions, etc.

# Google, or whatever site you use to browse the internet, is going to be your best friend
# when it comes to programming. 

# Now, to get started.
# First thing on our list is comments.
# Ironically, comments are us telling the *interpreter that this bit isn't code to be read.

# *What's an interpreter?
# Computers don't understand english, they work in binary code. Programming language are like
# bridges between human languages and computer binary. When you run a python program, something
# called an interpreter turns your code into binary code for the computer to... interpret...
# what it is being asked to do.

# It may sound weird that I'm telling you how to make the interpreter ignore things before
# teaching you how to code but, comments are really important in programming.
# Comments are used to explain to others reading your code, and yourself later on if you revisit
# your code, what you are doing at any stage. But comments can also be used to test and debugg
# your code.
# Often times, if you run into a problem or want to see how your program works wihout a couple lines
# of code, the best option is to just comment out those lines and run the code.

# Now, I already used a few comments, so you might already get it.
# But, to make a single line comment, you put a "#" in front of the line you want to comment out.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Make a comment about what you like the most in the world down here:

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# Yay, you made a single line comment. I sure as hell hope you did cause, if you didn't, I just
# made myself look stupid. Good job.

# I keep referring to it as a "single line comment", implying that there's more
# There is, technically. Nope. But let me explain.

"""
This can be considered a mult line comment. Technically. It works the part for sure. But it isn't
intended to be such.
"""
'''
This is the same as above. I'm using three instances of quotation marks, single or double, and
anything sandwiched between them is a long string that is never assigned to a variable and never
used anywhere in the code and so functions similarly to a comment (will get to strings and
variables in a quick bit).
'''

# Officially, there are no other types of comments, other than single line comments, in python.
# What I did above should not really be used and is just bad practice.
# If you really wanna use multiple lines of comments, comment out each line like I've done.

# Do this:
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Give yourself a nickname and write it here:

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# Good. Hope you picked a nice nickname.

# You now know how to make comments. How do you remove comments?
# Ding, ding ding. That's right, you get rid of the "#" from the front of the line.
# I really hope you are interested, I don't really enjoy acting like dora with no interaction.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Anyway, here's a line of code I've written down for you to uncomment and run:
# Tip: To run the code, open the terminal and type in "python 00_comments.py"
# How to open the console? Go to "Terminal" on the top left and click "New Terminal"
# Or you can just press Ctrl and single quotes together if you are on Windows.

#print("Hello, World!")
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# Good job. Why'd I choose to have you print "Hello, World!"? Idk. Just what I did and many before
# me as well.
