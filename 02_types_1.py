# Now that you're done with comments, let's move onto types of values

# However, before we start, I want to introduce you to the print() function.
# You used it earlier in the comments section, but it prints a value into the terminal.
# We'll be using the terminal a lot, so I hope you remeber how to use it.
# If not, I'll just write a tip before we need to use it.

# What do I mean with types of values?
# Well, in programming, there are different types of values. For example, "3" and 3
# are two different types of values that cannot be used interchangeably.

# There are lots of different value types in python, and we'll do individual activities
# for each of them, but I want to introduce you to some now before that.

# First type I'll introduce to you is a string.
# I've mentioned strings before, but, a string is anything that is surrounded by quotes.
# The below are some exapmples of strings:

"Hello, World!"
"$%££677^^&*"
"Apple"
"'Hi', he said"
"3"
"4 x 3"

# Even numbers, when surrounded by quotes, act as strings.
# Strings are usefull when you have to represent text or textual data in python.

# Exercise 1
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ #
# Use the print function below to print a string saying "Hello, Python"
# Tip1: You need to type out the string into the print function withon quotes.
# Tip2: To run, open new terminal by going to the top left of the window, terminal > new terminal.
# To run the code, type in "python 01_types_1.py" into the terminal

#print()
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ #

# Yay, you printed a string. Time to move onto the next value type.

# The next value type I want to introduce is an integer, or int for short.
# Integers are numeric values and can be used in things like calculations.
# Some exapmples of integers are:

3
-2
3348
10

# An integer in python is any whole number and it has a wide range of applications.

# Exercise 2
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ #
# Use the print function below to print an integer between 1 and 10:

#print()
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ #

# There are more types that are important for you to know, so I'll have those in the next file.
